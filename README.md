limitless-led
=============

A Ruby client library for controlling the [LimitlessLED v3.0 RGBW color-changing light bulbs] and [LimitlessLED v3.0 White light bulbs] (http://www.limitlessled.com/),
based on the official [LimitlessLED API documentation](http://www.limitlessled.com/dev/).

## Usage

    # White type
    light = LimitlessLed::White.new(host: '192.168.1.100', port: 8899)
    light.group_1_on   # group1 light is on
    light.group_2_warm # group2 light is warm white
    light.group_1_cool # group1 light is cool white or daylight

    light.group_1_brightness_up
    light.group_1_brightness_down
    light.group_1_brightness_max
    light.group_1_brightness_min

    light.all_on # all lights are on

    # Color type
    light = LimitlessLed::RGBW.new(host: '192.168.1.100', port: 8899)

    light.all_on        # all lights are on
    light.all_off       # all lights are off
    light.white         # all lights are white
    light.disco         # disco mode!
    light.disco_faster  # disco mode faster
    light.disco_slower  # disco mode slower

    # change the color by calling #color with either a color string, integer, or Color::RGB object
    # see: https://github.com/halostatue/color/blob/master/lib/color/rgb-colors.rb for a list
    # of all the named colors
    light.color 'Red'                # color is red
    light.color Color::RGB::Red      # color is red
    light.color 170                  # color is red

    # adjust brightness on a scale from 2 - 27 (27 is full brightness)
    bridge.brightness 27              # full brightness

    # control a single group
    group = bridge.group(1)           # supports up to 4 groups (1 - 4)
    group.color 'Blue'
    group.brightness 25
